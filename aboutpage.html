      <h1>I'm Laura-Ashlee</h1>
      <strong><small>Nice to Meet You</small></strong>
      <p>
        I'm the kind of person who wants to know all things.
        <br />This can sometimes be pretty cool when I'm learning something new
        within my hobbies. When I'm sewing, I get to learn about historical
        constuming and some bit of mechanical engineering. (Sewing machines are
        magic.) When I'm learning about rollerskating, I get all of the
        information about how not to break my arms, legs, and/or skull before I
        strap my skates on.
        <br />
        Programming, though, is different. I have to accept so much magic at the
        beginning in order to get my beginner project done. Still, each time I
        learn something new, I have the joy of going back and making something
        that worked into something that is efficent and maybe even a little
        elegant.
        <br />
        I'm excited to learn about web development so I can use these creative
        design skills I've developed in my other hobbies. Also, it's all a big
        puzzle. The person who wants to know all things can't simply leave a
        puzzle unfinished.
